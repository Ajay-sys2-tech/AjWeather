My name is Ajay Kumar Yadav and my biggest strength is that I am good a team player and everybody knows how crucial it is 
to be a good team player wherein people come from diverse culture and areas and I have also seen people 
who cannot make this, and they end up wasting their and other's time and resources another one I would like to add my ability
to work under stress


One thing which I would like to workupon to improve is
definately my communication and presentation skills
because at the end of the day each one of needs to 
present and express ourselves and I would never want to 
loose that game
